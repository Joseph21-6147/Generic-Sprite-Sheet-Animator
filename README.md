# Generic-Sprite-Sheet-Animator
A little tool that allows to play with the variables that are involved in sprite sheet animations. This can be useful to find out and test the exact subsprite dimensions and animation sequences. 

An example sprite sheet is also provided. 

The tool is based on one lone coder's olc::PixelGameEngine - cheers @Javidx9

Have fun with it!
